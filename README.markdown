Keyboard Shortcuts for Google Searchâ„¢
=====================================
A chrome extension that enables keyboard shortcuts for navigating Google search results. 
This extension mimics the functionality of the old Google keyboard shortcuts experiment 
that has been discontinued.

### TODO (unprioritized)
* Add configuration screen to customize keystrokes, colors, etc.
* Support other types of searchs (image search, video search, etc.)
* Figure out a way to coexist with google instant.
* Allow selection and navigation of ads.
* If you hit next on the last item of a page or prev on the first item of a page switch pages?
* What to do when the search button has focus and movement happens or enter/esc is pushed?
* Add Google Analytics tracking to better understand the size of the userbase.
* Shortcut for new window?
* g-w Go to web search, g-i Go to image search, etc.  Even on google home page.
* Remember which item/page was selected if you choose to navigate to one and then hit the back button.
